### Daily Notes Structure
- daily-curation/ (for daily summaries)
- YYYY-MM-DD.md files

### Current Categories (with issues)
- technology/ (has ai-ml/ subdir) - contains 1 article
- business/ (empty)
- industry/ (empty)
- reading/ (empty)
- tools/ (empty)
- insights/ (empty)

## Problems to Solve

1. Category naming: "ai-ml" should be more standard
2. Many empty categories with no content
3. No clear taxonomy for organizing future content
4. Need deployment documentation for future content creation

## Requirements

1. Design a proper taxonomy/classification system
2. Reorganize existing content into appropriate categories
3. Create index files for each category
4. Generate a deployment guide document (DEPLOYMENT.md) specifying:
   - Where to place different types of content
   - Naming conventions
   - Frontmatter requirements
   - How to create new categories

## Output

Please provide:
1. Proposed directory structure (as a tree)
2. New file locations for existing content
3. Content of key index files
4. Complete DEPLOYMENT.md guide

## Constraints

- Keep English for all directory names and file paths
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directory names (e.g., "artificial-intelligence" not "ai-ml")
- Ensure all navigation links work properly
- Make it scalable for future content
